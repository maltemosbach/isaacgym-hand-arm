    # Possible goals are ['lift', 'reposition', 'repose', 'place', 'throw']
    # 'lift' requires the policy to move the object to a height of 0.3m.
    # 'reposition' requires the policy to move the object to a different position.
    # 'oriented_reposition' requires the policy to move the object to a different position and achieve a specific orientation of the robot hand relative to the object, for example, held from above, held from the left, etc..
    # 'd' requires the policy to move the object such that it follows a specific trajectory.
    # 'throw' requires the policy to throw the object into a target bin.
